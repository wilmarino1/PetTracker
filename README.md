### Code Contributions

#### Setup Development Environment

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork: `git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/PawTracker-iOS.git`
3. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`
4. Open the project in Xcode 15.0+

#### Coding Guidelines

**Swift Style Guide**
- Follow [Swift API Design Guidelines](https://swift.org/documentation/api-design-guidelines/)
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Keep functions small and focused
- Add documentation comments for public APIs

**SwiftUI Best Practices**
- Use `@State` for local view state
- Use `@ObservedObject` or `@StateObject` for external data
- Keep views small and composable
- Extract complex layouts into separate view components

**Code Organization**
- Follow the established folder structure
- Group related functionality together
- Use extensions to organize protocol conformance
- Keep imports minimal and organized

#### Commit Guidelines

Use conventional commit messages:
- `feat:` new features
- `fix:` bug fixes
- `docs:` documentation changes
- `style:` code style changes
- `refactor:` code refactoring
- `test:` adding tests
- `chore:` maintenance tasks

Example: `feat: add medication reminder notifications`

#### Pull Request Process

1. Ensure your code follows the style guidelines

## Development Workflow

### Branch Strategy

- `main`: Production-ready code
- `develop`: Integration branch for features
- `feature/*`: New features
- `fix/*`: Bug fixes
- `release/*`: Release preparation

### Architecture Guidelines

**MVVM Pattern**
- Models: Data structures and Core Data entities
- Views: SwiftUI views (minimal logic)
- ViewModels: Business logic and data binding

**Services**
- DataManager: Core Data operations
- LocationManager: GPS and location services
- NotificationManager: Local notifications

### Core Data Guidelines

- Use meaningful entity and attribute names
- Set up proper relationships
- Handle migration when changing the model
- Use NSFetchedResultsController for efficient data fetching

## Project Priorities

### High Priority
- Core functionality (CRUD operations)
- Data persistence
- User experience
- Performance optimization

### Medium Priority
- Advanced features
- Integrations (HealthKit, CloudKit)
- Accessibility improvements

### Low Priority
- UI polish
- Additional customization options
- Nice-to-have features

## Getting Help
